## Hi there 👋

I am Niko Hyrkäs, an application developer from Finland.
Currently, I'm an employee in a small but very flexible company,
and since I'm also a father, flexibility is great for work and life balancing.

I am also a gamer (when I have free time), and the name Sehrentos comes from there.
